# Ruby-Basics

Just some *Ruby* code I've written as part of my prep work for the Flatiron Coding Bootcamp.

We had to go through a series of labs, and I've selected some of my solutions to the challenges to post on GitHub to mark the beginning of my foray into Ruby land ðŸš€.

The labs each had their own set of tests, so the code found in these files are typically just a set of functions to satisfy these tests.
